 ### Battle Features ###

 A: Run{
    AI USUAGE:{
        None.
    }

    Thought-Process: {
      I should have a new menu option for the run feature. Then, Looking at the code, I can see that I will need to add a definition for what is suppose to happen when the player decides to run, just as  the it defined for the the Status and Fight functionalities. Once I have that, I will need to define a run method that will pop the previous states in order to bring the player back into walking state.
    }

    Problems: {
      I thought I had to push to the stack a new playState in the run method but after tracing the stack of states, I just figured I could pop twice and boom, back into walking state which is the one I actualy want the player to be in and not playState.
    }

 }

  B: Stat Change Panel{
    AI USUAGE:{
      Assistant: I couldn't display the custom state I had made for the stats, and I asked Claude for some help and it proposed to just use the diagloue state as it was a lot simpler than having a different state, but that change also didn't work because I wasn't using the pokmon_stats in the parameters, so after using that I got it to work.
    }

    Thought-Process: {
      After a Pokemon levels up, the player should see how their stats improved. I need to capture the old stats before calling levelUp(), then the new stats after, and display them in a panel. Looking at how DialogueState works, I can use the same approach - create a new state that shows the stat comparisons in a "Health: X > Y" format. I'll use Panel.POKEMON_STATS for positioning and just format the stats as a multi-line string that gets passed to DialogueState.
    }

    Problems: {
      Initially tried creating a custom StatChangeState with manual text rendering using context.fillText, but the text wasn't showing up. Turns out I was trying to use this.panel.context which doesn't exist. Then realized I could just use DialogueState with a formatted string instead of building a whole new state, which was way simpler and already handles all the rendering properly.
    }

 }

  C: Progress Bar{
    AI USUAGE:{
      Assistant: I kept on seeing the health bar drop instantly and it was also out of sync, meaning that I could get hit and the bar wouldn't update then I get hit again then my health takes a big dive from the 2 previous hits (this health wouldn't drop as soos as i get hit), so I asked Claude to help me out with that bug, I had to play around with the tween timer to slow it down and had to make sure to always update the health tweener as soos as somebody gets hit.
    }

    Thought-Process: {
      The health and experience bars need to tween smoothly instead of jumping instantly. For health, I need a forceTweenHealth method that animates the healthBarWidth when Pokemon take damage. For experience, I should add a gainExperience method to the player panel that uses timer.tween to animate the experience bar filling up. Both tweens should update their respective bar widths gradually and call callbacks when done so the next battle action can happen after the animations finish.
    }

    Problems: {
    Had to make sure the experience tween completes before checkingfor level up, otherwise the level up message would appear while the bar was still animating. Fixed this by passing a callback to gainExperience that triggers processLevelUp only after the tween finishes. Same issue with health - needed to call forceTweenHealth with a slight delay after damage is applied so the health bar animates smoothly instead of instantly dropping.
    }

 }


  D: Moves{
    AI USUAGE:{
      Assistant: Claude pointed out to me the input issue since I was using wrong names and the selection of a move wouldn't work at all. I also asked it for help loading the moves from the json because I would get some console erros saying that the file wasn't readable, turns out it was a typo in the path to the json so it helped me fix that too.
    }

    Thought-Process: {
      Pokemon need actual moves instead of just a generic attack. I'll need to create a Move class with properties like name, type, and damage. Then give each Pokemon a moveset and create a move selection menu in battle. When the player picks Fight, it should show a grid of available moves. Once a move is selected, BattleTurnState needs to know which move was picked so it can calculate damage based on the move's power instead of using the default inflictDamage.
    }

    Problems: {
      Had to pass the selected move through the state chain, from the move selection menu to BattleMenuState to BattleTurnState. Also needed to make sure the opponent picks a random move from their moveset so both sides are using actual moves. The attack message needed to show the move name instead of just "attacked" for both player and opponent. And at some point there was an issue with caluclating the damage, I would end up 1 shoting the oppenent, so I had to re-tweek the inflict damage. Also there was a little bug with the inputs I was using in the code, I wrote their names wrong and that broke the event listener for inputs because the names didn't match what was in the input.js
    }

 }


  E: Type Effectiveness{
    AI USUAGE:{
      Assistant: I asked Claude to help me out with calulcating the damage ratio, I got this little bug of 1 shotting the opponent, turns out I was dividing by a really small number, so claude told me to re-adjust with a larger dividant to fix it. And also there was a mismatch with the name of the sounds, so Claude also pointed that out to me.
    }

    Thought-Process: {
      I need a TypeEffectiveness service with a chart that maps move types to defender types with multipliers (0.5 for not very effective, 1 for neutral, 2 for super effective). When calculating damage, multiply the base damage by the effectiveness multiplier. Also need to show messages like "It's super effective!" and play different hit sounds based on effectiveness.
    }

    Problems: {
      The effectiveness sounds weren't playing because the sound names in TypeEffectiveness were returning PascalCase like "HitSuperEffective" but the actual loaded sounds were kebab-case like "hit-super-effective". Fixed it by returning the correct string format from getEffectivenessSound. Also had to make sure the opponent's attacks also use type effectiveness, not just the player's, so I needed to pass the selected move to inflictDamage for both player and opponent.  
    }
